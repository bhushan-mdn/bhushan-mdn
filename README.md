## üöÄ Workflow & Philosophy

My efficiency is terminal-driven, rooted in decades of FOSS enthusiasm.

- Environment: I run Arch Linux with Sway WM and use the ergonomic Colemak keyboard layout.

- Editor: My core workflow is built around Vim/Neovim within tmux/Zellij sessions.

- Inspiration: Deeply influenced by the efficiency workflows of ThePrimeagen, Luke Smith, and the broader FOSS community (DistroTube, r/unixporn).

- Hardware: I enjoy breathing life into old hardware with Linux, especially ThinkPads, and maintain a private homelab for ongoing software and hardware projects.
