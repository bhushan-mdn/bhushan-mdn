## üöÄ Workflow & FOSS Ethos

My engineering efficiency is terminal-driven, rooted in the FOSS community:

* **Environment:** I run **Arch Linux** with **Sway WM** and use the **Colemak** keyboard layout.
* **Editor:** My workflow is built around **Vim/Neovim** within **tmux/Zellij** sessions.
* **Passions:** **Homelab** automation, electronics, and rejuvenating old hardware (especially **ThinkPads**) with Linux.
* **Inspiration:** Deeply influenced by the workflows of ThePrimeagen, Luke Smith, and r/unixporn.
* **Research:** Current interests include Distributed Systems and OpSec.
